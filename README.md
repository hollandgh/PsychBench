This repository contains all code for the open source parts of PsychBench. This is intended for people who want to contribute to this code. It is not necessary to pull from here to actually install or use PsychBench--for that see the standard installer at [www.psychbench.org](https://www.psychbench.org).

These folders mirror folders in any local PsychBench installation:

/element types - code for element types that come with PsychBench

/tools - code for tools for experiment building

/element type programming/general - code for general tools for element type programming

See README.md files in each folder for summaries of their contents.

A few other files are also in the root folder:

pb_install.m - PsychBench installer, available at www.psychbench.org

gui.js â€“ Google Apps Script (~JS) code for the graphical user interface, attached to any experiment spreadsheet in Google Sheets
