An adjuster and response recorder element that lets the subject adjust properties of other elements by key press. Also works with other "keyboard-like" devices. Use property .deltas to assign keys to adjustment values and one key to say done adjusting. By default waits for one "done adjusting" response, then ends on its own (so you don't need to set property .end unless you want it to end earlier). You can use properties to record multiple responses and set other options.





INPUT PROPERTIES
You can set input properties to specify how an object will show or run.
To leave any property at default, omit it (or leave = []).
==========



----------
Adjustable properties

You can allow the subject to adjust the following input properties of an object of this class during the experiment using an adjuster element. If you need to make other properties adjustable, you can edit the element class.

(None)



----------
n_device    DEFAULT: default device, usually keyboard.

(Psychtoolbox framework only)

Optionally you can listen for input from some other "keyboard-like" device. .n_device is HID device number to listen to. You can use Psychtoolbox functions GetKeyboardIndices or PsychHID('Devices') to see available device numbers. A keyAdjuster element uses Psychtoolbox KbCheck underneath and .n_device goes to the input of that function. See help for these functions for more information. [] = default device according to Psychtoolbox, usually the keyboard.



----------
deltas    NO DEFAULT.

A 1-column cell array with each row assigning a key or key combination (e.g. shift + left arrow) to an adjustment value:

{column 1} key number, or vector of key numbers for a key combination. Key numbers depend on operating system and whether you are using the Psychtoolbox or MGL framework. In Psychtoolbox, function KBSHOW is a quick way to find them; see also Psychtoolbox KBNAME. In MGL, use function MGLSHOWKEYS; see also MGLCHARTOKEYCODE, MGLKEYCODETOCHAR.

{column 2} numeric value (not necessarily scalar) that is adjustment to apply when the key(s) are pressed.

Usually you also want to assign a key the subject can press to input that they are done adjusting (the "response"). Do this using the string "r" in column 2.

Use .adjust to set where and how adjustments are applied.



----------
repeatDelay    DEFAULT: 0.5 sec
repeatRate     DEFAULT: 4 adjustments/sec

.repeatDelay is delay before repeating adjustment (sec) when subject holds key(s) down.

.repeatRate is adjustment repeat rate (adjustments/sec).



----------
INPUT PROPERTIES ALL OBJECTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 1 for full documentation. ***


- label     DEFAULT: none.
Struct with any fields containing any values you want as custom information to see for the object in experiment results. Field names go to headings in results table. [] = none.

- report    DEFAULT: none.
Array of strings that are names of properties to see for the object in experiment results. [] = none.



----------
INPUT PROPERTIES ALL ELEMENTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 2 for full documentation. ***


- start             DEFAULT: no start cues.
Start time/cue(s) in the trial for the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .t, timeFromSync, startOf, endOf, response, responseBy, trigger, triggerBy, and, timeFrom. [] = no start cues -> element doesn't run.

- end               DEFAULT: no end cues.
End time/cue(s) in the trial for the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .t, timeFromSync, duration, startOf, endOf, response, responseBy, trigger, triggerBy, and, timeFrom. [] = no end cues -> element runs indefinitely unless it can end on its own.

- startBuffer
- endBuffer         DEFAULTS: none.
Time buffer to start/end (sec) if bufferable start/end latency occurs. Only for experiments where precise timing is important.

- syncExperimentAtTrigger
Not used by this class.

- staircase         DEFAULT: don't staircase element.
Staircase one or more input properties of the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .target, setExpr, min, max, setStaircaseExpr. [] = don't staircase element.



----------
INPUT PROPERTIES ALL RESPONSE RECORDER ELEMENTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 2.2 for full documentation. ***


- translateResponse            DEFAULT: use raw response values.
2-column array with col 1 possible raw response values, col 2 values to translate to. Numeric array if all values are numbers, else cell array. OR string: MATLAB expression for PsychBench to use to translate. [] = use raw response values.

- scoreResponse                DEFAULT: don't score response.
true/false: score response using MATLAB ISEQUALN. OR string: MATLAB expression for PsychBench to use to score response.

- correctResponse              DEFAULT: [].
Correct response value(s). Needed if you set .scoreResponse.

- maxNumResponses              DEFAULT: 1.
Element will end on its own when it records this many responses. inf = no limit.

- recordDefaultResponse        DEFAULT: don't record "no response".
true/false: record response = [] if no response recorded by end.

- scoreResponseForStaircase    DEFAULT: automatic.
true/false: any staircase for the trial gets response score from this response recorder. [] = automatic if only one response recorder scores a response in the trial.



----------
INPUT PROPERTIES ALL ADJUSTER ELEMENTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 2.3 for full documentation. ***


- adjust    DEFAULT: adjuster doesn't apply adjustments.
Specify which other element(s) and property(s) to apply adjustments to and further options. Further struct with one or more fields: .target, setExpr, min, max. [] = none.





RECORD PROPERTIES
PsychBench uses record properties to record information during experiments.
You can't set record properties but you can see them in experiment results using input property .report.

String: variable name and possibly index you used for the object in the experiment script, e.g. "pictures(2)".

Frame number in the trial for first/last frames the element ran in. Start time = first frame start time. End time = last frame end time.

- startLatencyBufferable
- endLatencyBufferable
Start/End delay that might be reducible by setting .startBuffer/.endBuffer (sec). Only for experiments where precise timing is important.
