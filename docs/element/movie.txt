Plays a movie file of various formats. By default ends on its own when the file ends (so you don't need to set property .end unless you want it to end earlier). You can set property .repeat if you want to change this. Psychtoolbox/PsychBench needs GStreamer installed to play movies, and movie file formats are as supported by GStreamer. See http://psychtoolbox.org/docs/GStreamer for more information.





INPUT PROPERTIES
You can set input properties to specify how an object will show or run.
To leave any property at default, omit it (or leave = []).
==========



----------
Adjustable properties

You can allow the subject to adjust the following input properties of an object of this class during the experiment using an adjuster element. If you need to make other properties adjustable, you can edit the element class.

position
nn_eyes
rotate
opacity



----------
fileName    NO DEFAULT.

A string that is name of movie file to show. Include path if the file is not in the MATLAB current folder or search path (or not the first file with that name on the search path).



----------
height    DEFAULT: fit movie to screen.

Height on screen (deg). Or a string "f" = fit whole movie to screen.



----------
startTimeInMovie    DEFAULT: start at start of file.

Time in movie to start at (sec). 0 = start.



----------
speed    DEFAULT: normal.

Play speed: 1 = normal, -1 = backward, etc. Not all play speeds are possible for all movie formats--see Psychtoolbox Screen('PlayMovie') for more information.



----------
repeat    DEFAULT: element ends on its own when movie file ends.

true/false: play indefinitely by repeating until a cue you set in property .end occurs. If false, the element ends on its own at end of movie file. Or a number > 1 for more options--see Psychtoolbox Screen('PlayMovie').



----------
volume    DEFAULT: 0 (disabled).

A number between 0-1 setting sound volume.

Note: If you set volume > 0 to enable any audio in the movie, start time of audio / start time of the movie time course may deviate slightly from start time of video / recorded element start time (record property .startTime, PsychBench Reference Manual sec 2.1). If you set volume = 0, these times are always precisely the same. The deviation for volume disabled is not noticeable and insignificant in most contexts. However, you can see the difference by running two identical movie elements beside each other starting at the same time. With volume enabled they may be slightly but noticeably out of sync. With volume = 0 they will be precisely in sync.



----------
INPUT PROPERTIES ALL OBJECTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 1 for full documentation. ***


- label     DEFAULT: none.
Struct with any fields containing any values you want as custom information to see for the object in experiment results. Field names go to headings in results table. [] = none.

- report    DEFAULT: none.
Array of strings that are names of properties to see for the object in experiment results. [] = none.



----------
INPUT PROPERTIES ALL ELEMENTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 2 for full documentation. ***


- start             DEFAULT: no start cues.
Start time/cue(s) in the trial for the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .t, timeFromSync, startOf, endOf, response, responseBy, trigger, triggerBy, and, timeFrom. [] = no start cues -> element doesn't run.

- end               DEFAULT: no end cues.
End time/cue(s) in the trial for the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .t, timeFromSync, duration, startOf, endOf, response, responseBy, trigger, triggerBy, and, timeFrom. [] = no end cues -> element runs indefinitely unless it can end on its own.

- startBuffer
- endBuffer         DEFAULTS: none.
Time buffer to start/end (sec) if bufferable start/end latency occurs. Only for experiments where precise timing is important.

- syncExperimentAtTrigger
Not used by this class.

- staircase         DEFAULT: don't staircase element.
Staircase one or more input properties of the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .target, setExpr, min, max, setStaircaseExpr. [] = don't staircase element.



----------
INPUT PROPERTIES ALL VISUAL ELEMENTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 2.1 for full documentation. ***


- position          DEFAULT: screen center.
Vector [x y] setting position on screen (deg). - = left/up, + = right/down, [0 0] = screen center.

- layer             DEFAULT: 0.
Number setting layering on screen. + = backward.

- nn_eyes           DEFAULT: both eyes.
1 = show on left eye, 2 = right eye, [1 2] = both eyes. Ignored if stereo display is of (screen object property .stereo).

- rotate            DEFAULT: 0 deg.
Rotation clockwise (+x -> +y screen axis) about position set in .position (deg). (Psychtoolbox framework only)

- flipHorz
- flipVert          DEFAULTS: don't flip.
true/false: flip horizontally/vertically. (Psychtoolbox framework only)

- opacity           DEFAULT: no additional transparency.
0-1: 0 = fully transparent, 1 = nominal. (Psychtoolbox framework only)

- blur              DEFAULT: don't blur.
Blur filter level: width/diameter (box/disk) or standard deviation (Gaussian) of filter kernel on screen (deg). 0 = no blur. Ignored if .filterKernel set. (Psychtoolbox framework only)

- filterType        DEFAULT: Gaussian.
Blur filter type. String: "box", "disc", "gaussian". (Psychtoolbox framework only)

- filterKernel      DEFAULT: ignored.
Matrix: Custom convolution filter kernel. If you set .filterResolution then this is in the downsampled space. [] = use .blur instead instead. (Psychtoolbox framework only)

- filterResolution  DEFAULT: filter applied at screen resolution.
0-1: 1 = apply blur or other filter to element display at resolution on screen. < 1 = apply at lower resolution, then scale to screen. (Psychtoolbox framework only)

- backColor         DEFAULT: black.
RGB vector with numbers between 0-1 setting element background color if blur/filter is on. Ignored if blur/filter is off (most elements have transparent background then). (Psychtoolbox framework only)





RECORD PROPERTIES
PsychBench uses record properties to record information during experiments.
You can't set record properties but you can see them in experiment results using input property .report.

RECORD PROPERTIES ALL OBJECTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 1 for full documentation. ***
