(PSYCHTOOLBOX FRAMEWORK ONLY)

Sends data from a serial port when the element starts, then registers a trigger and ends on its own (so you don't need to set property .end unless you want it to end earlier). You can set any elements to start or end from the trigger (element properties .start/.end). You can also synchronize the experiment at the trigger using this element's .syncExperimentAtTrigger, then set any elements to start or end from sync (element properties .start/.end) and set later trials to start from sync (trial object property .start).

Trigger value recorded in record property .trigger is a row vector of bytes (integers 0-255) sent. Trigger time recorded in .triggerTime is time send complete relative to trial start, which is generally slightly less than element end time.





INPUT PROPERTIES
You can set input properties to specify how an object will show or run.
To leave any property at default, omit it (or leave = []).
==========



----------
Adjustable properties

You can allow the subject to adjust the following input properties of an object of this class during the experiment using an adjuster element. If you need to make other properties adjustable, you can edit the element class.

(None)



----------
portName    NO DEFAULT.

A string that is the name of the serial port, as accepted by Psychtoolbox IOPort('OpenSerialPort'). From Psychtoolbox documentation: On Windows this could be, e.g. "COM1", "COM2", etc.; on Mac it is a path to a BSD device file, e.g. "/dev/cu.usbserial-FT3Z95V5" for a serial-over-USB device with unique ID FT3Z95V5; on Linux e.g. "/dev/ttyS0" for the first real serial port, "/dev/ttyUSB0" for the first serial-over-USB device, etc.



----------
data    NO DEFAULT.

Row vectors of bytes (integers 0-255) to send.



----------
options    DEFAULT: Psychtoolbox default.

A string that goes to Psychtoolbox IOPort('OpenSerialPort') input .configString. Type "IOPort OpenSerialPort?" for more information. [] = Psychtoolbox default, which usually you can leave.



----------
INPUT PROPERTIES ALL OBJECTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 1 for full documentation. ***


- label     DEFAULT: none.
Struct with any fields containing any values you want as custom information to see for the object in experiment results. Field names go to headings in results table. [] = none.

- report    DEFAULT: none.
Array of strings that are names of properties to see for the object in experiment results. [] = none.



----------
INPUT PROPERTIES ALL ELEMENTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 2 for full documentation. ***


- start             DEFAULT: no start cues.
Start time/cue(s) in the trial for the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .t, timeFromSync, startOf, endOf, response, responseBy, trigger, triggerBy, and, timeFrom. [] = no start cues -> element doesn't run.

- end               DEFAULT: no end cues.
End time/cue(s) in the trial for the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .t, timeFromSync, duration, startOf, endOf, response, responseBy, trigger, triggerBy, and, timeFrom. [] = no end cues -> element runs indefinitely unless it can end on its own.

- startBuffer
- endBuffer         DEFAULTS: none.
Time buffer to start/end (sec) if bufferable start/end latency occurs. Only for experiments where precise timing is important.

- syncExperimentAtTrigger    DEFAULT: element doesn't sync experiment.
true/false: sync the experiment when this element registers a trigger.

- staircase         DEFAULT: don't staircase element.
Staircase one or more input properties of the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .target, setExpr, min, max, setStaircaseExpr. [] = don't staircase element.





RECORD PROPERTIES
PsychBench uses record properties to record information during experiments.
You can't set record properties but you can see them in experiment results using input property .report.

----------
RECORD PROPERTIES ALL OBJECTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 1 for full documentation. ***


- who
String: variable name and possibly index you used for the object in the experiment script, e.g. "pictures(2)".



----------
RECORD PROPERTIES ALL ELEMENTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 2 for full documentation. ***


- startTime
â€“ endTime
Start/End time relative to trial 1 start (sec).

- duration
End time - start time (sec).

- n_startFrame
- n_endFrame
Frame number in the trial for first/last frames the element ran in. Start time = first frame start time. End time = last frame end time.

- startLatencyBufferable
- endLatencyBufferable
Start/End delay that might be reducible by setting .startBuffer/.endBuffer (sec). Only for experiments where precise timing is important.

- syncTime
Experiment synchronization time set by this element, relative to trial 1 start (sec). [] = none.

- trigger
Trigger value(s) registered.

- triggerTime
Trigger time(s) relative to trial 1 start (sec).

- d_triggerTime
Uncertainty in trigger time(s) if elements checks for trigger once per frame (sec). Range = +/- d_triggerTime.

- n_triggerFrame
Frame number in the trial when trigger(s) was registered.

- numTriggers
Number of triggers registered.
