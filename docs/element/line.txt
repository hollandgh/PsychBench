A line or set of lines.





INPUT PROPERTIES
You can set input properties to specify how an object will show or run.
To leave any property at default, omit it (or leave = []).
==========



----------
Adjustable properties

You can allow the subject to adjust the following input properties of an object of this class during the experiment using an adjuster element. If you need to make other properties adjustable, you can edit the element class.

(None)



----------
points    NO DEFAULT.

A 1x4 vector [x1 y1 x2 y2] setting line start and end points (deg). Coordinates are relative to element position which you can set in .position (default relative to screen center).

For multiple lines use an nx4 matrix with rows corresponding to lines.



----------
width    DEFAULT: 0.05 deg

Line width (deg).

For multiple lines of different widths using a row (1xn) vector with numbers corresponding to lines. For multiple lines of the same width you can use one number.



----------
color    DEFAULT: white.

A 1x3 RGB vector with numbers between 0-1.

For multiple lines of different colors use an nx3 matrix with rows corresponding to lines. For multiple lines of the same color you can use one vector.



----------
INPUT PROPERTIES ALL OBJECTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 1 for full documentation. ***


- label     DEFAULT: none.
Struct with any fields containing any values you want as custom information to see for the object in experiment results. Field names go to headings in results table. [] = none.

- report    DEFAULT: none.
Array of strings that are names of properties to see for the object in experiment results. [] = none.



----------
INPUT PROPERTIES ALL ELEMENTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 2 for full documentation. ***


- start             DEFAULT: no start cues.
Start time/cue(s) in the trial for the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .t, timeFromSync, startOf, endOf, response, responseBy, trigger, triggerBy, and, timeFrom. [] = no start cues -> element doesn't run.

- end               DEFAULT: no end cues.
End time/cue(s) in the trial for the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .t, timeFromSync, duration, startOf, endOf, response, responseBy, trigger, triggerBy, and, timeFrom. [] = no end cues -> element runs indefinitely unless it can end on its own.

- startBuffer
- endBuffer         DEFAULTS: none.
Time buffer to start/end (sec) if bufferable start/end latency occurs. Only for experiments where precise timing is important.

- syncExperimentAtTrigger
Not used by this class.

- staircase         DEFAULT: don't staircase element.
Staircase one or more input properties of the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .target, setExpr, min, max, setStaircaseExpr. [] = don't staircase element.



----------
INPUT PROPERTIES ALL VISUAL ELEMENTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 2.1 for full documentation. ***


- position          DEFAULT: screen center.
Vector [x y] setting position on screen (deg). - = left/up, + = right/down, [0 0] = screen center.

- layer             DEFAULT: 0.
Number setting layering on screen. + = backward.

- nn_eyes           DEFAULT: both eyes.
1 = show on left eye, 2 = right eye, [1 2] = both eyes. Ignored if stereo display is of (screen object property .stereo).

- opacity           DEFAULT: no additional transparency.
0-1: 0 = fully transparent, 1 = nominal. (Psychtoolbox framework only)

- rotate
- flipHorz
- flipVert
- blur
- filterType
- filterKernel
- filterResolution
- backColor
Currently not implemented for this class.





RECORD PROPERTIES
PsychBench uses record properties to record information during experiments.
You can't set record properties but you can see them in experiment results using input property .report.

----------
RECORD PROPERTIES ALL OBJECTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 1 for full documentation. ***


- who
String: variable name and possibly index you used for the object in the experiment script, e.g. "pictures(2)".



----------
RECORD PROPERTIES ALL ELEMENTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 2 for full documentation. ***


- startTime
â€“ endTime
Start/End time relative to trial 1 start (sec).

- duration
End time - start time (sec).

- n_startFrame
- n_endFrame
Frame number in the trial for first/last frames the element ran in. Start time = first frame start time. End time = last frame end time.

- startLatencyBufferable
- endLatencyBufferable
Start/End delay that might be reducible by setting .startBuffer/.endBuffer (sec). Only for experiments where precise timing is important.

- syncTime
- trigger
- triggerTime
- d_triggerTime
- n_triggerFrame
- numTriggers
Not used by this class.
