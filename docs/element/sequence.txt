An element of class sequence is a "container" element which you can link to any number of other elements that you also make for the trial. The sequence element runs those elements in a sequence, possibly repeating. For example, you could use a sequence element containing two picture elements to run a change blindness flicker paradigm where the pictures show alternating until the subject responds.

You only need to set start and end cues (properties .start/.end) for the sequence element, not for the elements in it. The sequence element starts and ends them, and alternates between them, automatically. Note if the sequence starts with an element then sequence element start time = start time of that element, and the same applies for end times.

Most elements can work in a sequence element. Occasionally there are elements that currently cannot (elements that are not "pausable"). PsychBench will tell you if so.

e.g.

sequence.elementExprs = ["pictures(1)" ""   "pictures(2)" ""  ]
sequence.intervals    = [0.5           0.25 0.5           0.25];
sequence.repeat       = true

-> run a repeating sequence of pictures(1) and pictures(2) with gaps between them. The pictures show for 500 msec and the gaps are 250 msec.





INPUT PROPERTIES
You can set input properties to specify how an object will show or run.
To leave any property at default, omit it (or leave = []).
==========



----------
Adjustable properties

You can allow the subject to adjust the following input properties of an object of this class during the experiment using an adjuster element. If you need to make other properties adjustable, you can edit the element class.

(None)



----------
elementExprs    DEFAULT: none.

A string or array of strings pointing to other elements by variable names and possibly indexes you use in the experiment script. You can include empty strings for gaps in the sequence. e.g. ["pictures(1)" "" "pictures(2)" ""].

Tip: If you have an index in a numeric variable you can use it in a "x" string (but not a 'x' string) like this: "pictures(" + n + ")".



----------
intervals    DEFAULT: 1 sec.

A number that is interval to run each element before switching to the next one (sec). Or a row vector of multiple intervals for different intervals for some or all of them.



----------
repeat    DEFAULT: repeat.

true/false: repeat the sequence. true = the sequence repeats until a cue you set in property .end. false = the sequence ends on its own when the last element in it ends, so you don't need to set .end for it.



----------
INPUT PROPERTIES ALL OBJECTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 1 for full documentation. ***


- label     DEFAULT: none.
Struct with any fields containing any values you want as custom information to see for the object in experiment results. Field names go to headings in results table. [] = none.

- report    DEFAULT: none.
Array of strings that are names of properties to see for the object in experiment results. [] = none.



----------
INPUT PROPERTIES ALL ELEMENTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 2 for full documentation. ***


- start             DEFAULT: no start cues.
Start time/cue(s) in the trial for the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .t, timeFromSync, startOf, endOf, response, responseBy, trigger, triggerBy, and, timeFrom. [] = no start cues -> element doesn't run.

- end               DEFAULT: no end cues.
End time/cue(s) in the trial for the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .t, timeFromSync, duration, startOf, endOf, response, responseBy, trigger, triggerBy, and, timeFrom. [] = no end cues -> element runs indefinitely unless it can end on its own.

- startBuffer
- endBuffer         DEFAULTS: none.
Time buffer to start/end (sec) if bufferable start/end latency occurs. Only for experiments where precise timing is important.

- syncExperimentAtTrigger    DEFAULT: element doesn't sync experiment.
true/false: sync the experiment when this element registers a trigger.

- staircase         DEFAULT: don't staircase element.
Staircase one or more input properties of the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .target, setExpr, min, max, setStaircaseExpr. [] = don't staircase element.





RECORD PROPERTIES
PsychBench uses record properties to record information during experiments.
You can't set record properties but you can see them in experiment results using input property .report.

- who
String: variable name and possibly index you used for the object in the experiment script, e.g. "pictures(2)".

- startTime
â€“ endTime
Start/End time relative to trial 1 start (sec).

- duration
End time - start time (sec).

- n_startFrame
- n_endFrame
Frame number in the trial for first/last frames the element ran in. Start time = first frame start time. End time = last frame end time.

- startLatencyBufferable
- endLatencyBufferable
Start/End delay that might be reducible by setting .startBuffer/.endBuffer (sec). Only for experiments where precise timing is important.

- syncTime
Experiment synchronization time set by this element, relative to trial 1 start (sec). [] = none.

- trigger
Trigger value(s) registered.

- triggerTime
Trigger time(s) relative to trial 1 start (sec).

- d_triggerTime
Uncertainty in trigger time(s) if elements checks for trigger once per frame (sec). Range = +/- d_triggerTime.

- n_triggerFrame
Frame number in the trial when trigger(s) was registered.
