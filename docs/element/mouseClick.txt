A response recorder element that records subject response by mouse click. By default waits for one click anywhere on screen, records mouse button number clicked, then ends on its own (so you don't need to set property .end unless you want it to end earlier). You can use properties to specify areas on screen and record area number clicked instead, record multiple responses, etc. May not work with trackpads.





INPUT PROPERTIES
You can set input properties to specify how an object will show or run.
To leave any property at default, omit it (or leave = []).

----------
Adjustable properties

You can allow the subject to adjust the following input properties of an object of this class during the experiment using an adjuster element. If you need to make other properties adjustable, you can edit the element class.

(None)



----------
rects    DEFAULT: click anywhere and response value = mouse button number.

If you set .rects, response value is a number corresponding to an area on screen clicked (1, 2, 3, ...). Set one or more rectangular areas using a 4-column matrix with rows corresponding to area numbers and each row a rect [x_tl y_tl x_br y_br] defining the area by its top left and bottom right coordinates (deg). Coordinates are relative to element position which you can set in property .position (default relative to screen center). For any coordinate -inf = left/top screen edge, +inf = right/bottom edge.

If you position other elements at these areas and set their sizes to correspond, you can build the effect of clicking on them--e.g. text elements with background boxes.

OR

[] = Subject can click anywhere and response value is mouse button number clicked.



----------
cursorShape    DEFAULT: current mouse cursor shape.

(Psychtoolbox framework only)

A string or number setting mouse cursor shape. This goes to the "type" input of Psychtoolbox ShowCursor--see there for more information. Standard options are:

"Arrow"
"CrossHair"
"Hand"
"SandClock"
"TextCursor"

[] = current shape.

INPUT PROPERTIES ALL OBJECTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 1 for full documentation. ***


- label     DEFAULT: none.
Struct with any fields containing any values you want as custom information to see for the object in experiment results. Field names go to headings in results table. [] = none.

- report    DEFAULT: none.
Array of strings that are names of properties to see for the object in experiment results. [] = none.

INPUT PROPERTIES ALL ELEMENTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 2 for full documentation. ***


- start             DEFAULT: no start cues.
Start time/cue(s) in the trial for the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .t, timeFromSync, startOf, endOf, response, responseBy, trigger, triggerBy, and, timeFrom. [] = no start cues -> element doesn't run.

- end               DEFAULT: no end cues.
End time/cue(s) in the trial for the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .t, timeFromSync, duration, startOf, endOf, response, responseBy, trigger, triggerBy, and, timeFrom. [] = no end cues -> element runs indefinitely unless it can end on its own.

- startBuffer
- endBuffer         DEFAULTS: none.
Time buffer to start/end (sec) if bufferable start/end latency occurs. Only for experiments where precise timing is important.

- syncExperimentAtTrigger
Not used by this class.

- staircase         DEFAULT: don't staircase element.
Staircase one or more input properties of the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .target, setExpr, min, max, setStaircaseExpr. [] = don't staircase element.



----------
INPUT PROPERTIES ALL VISUAL ELEMENTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 2.1 for full documentation. ***


- position          DEFAULT: screen center.
Vector [x y] setting position on screen (deg). - = left/up, + = right/down, [0 0] = screen center.

- layer
- nn_eyes
- rotate
- flipHorz
- flipVert
- opacity
- blur
- filterType
- filterKernel
- filterResolution
- backColor
Not used by this class.



----------
INPUT PROPERTIES ALL RESPONSE RECORDER ELEMENTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 2.2 for full documentation. ***


- translateResponse            DEFAULT: use raw response values.
2-column array with col 1 possible raw response values, col 2 values to translate to. Numeric array if all values are numbers, else cell array. OR string: MATLAB expression for PsychBench to use to translate. [] = use raw response values.

- scoreResponse                DEFAULT: don't score response.
true/false: score response using MATLAB ISEQUALN. OR string: MATLAB expression for PsychBench to use to score response.

- correctResponse              DEFAULT: [].
Correct response value(s). Needed if you set .scoreResponse.

- maxNumResponses              DEFAULT: 1.
Element will end on its own when it records this many responses. inf = no limit.

- recordDefaultResponse        DEFAULT: don't record "no response".
true/false: record response = [] if no response recorded by end.

- scoreResponseForStaircase    DEFAULT: automatic.
true/false: any staircase for the trial gets response score from this response recorder. [] = automatic if only one response recorder scores a response in the trial.





RECORD PROPERTIES
PsychBench uses record properties to record information during experiments.
You can't set record properties but you can see them in experiment results using input property .report.
