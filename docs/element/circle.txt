A circle or ellipse. Options for border and solid or transparent fill allow a circular/elliptical frame (ring, annulus) as well.





INPUT PROPERTIES
You can set input properties to specify how an object will show or run.
To leave any property at default, omit it (or leave = []).
==========



----------
Adjustable properties

You can allow the subject to adjust the following input properties of an object of this class during the experiment using an adjuster element. If you need to make other properties adjustable, you can edit the element class.

position
nn_eyes
rotate
opacity



----------
size    DEFAULT: circle with diameter 8 deg.

Diameter for a circle, or a vector [width height] for an ellipse (deg).



----------
showFill    DEFAULT: solid circle.
color       DEFAULT: white.

.showFill is true/false. false = inside is transparent but you can still show a border for a circular frame effect (property .showBorder below).

.color is a 1x3 RGB vector with numbers between 0-1 setting fill color.



---------
showBorder     DEFAULT: no border.
borderWidth    DEFAULT: 0.15 deg.
borderColor    DEFAULT: white.

.showBorder = true/false. If you show a border the dimensions set in .size above are its outer dimensions. NOTE: Currently to show a border the element must be a circle (property .size = one number for diameter).

.borderWidth is a number (deg).

.borderColor is a 1x3 RGB vector with numbers between 0-1.



----------
INPUT PROPERTIES ALL OBJECTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 1 for full documentation. ***


- label     DEFAULT: none.
Struct with any fields containing any values you want as custom information to see for the object in experiment results. Field names go to headings in results table. [] = none.

- report    DEFAULT: none.
Array of strings that are names of properties to see for the object in experiment results. [] = none.



----------
INPUT PROPERTIES ALL ELEMENTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 2 for full documentation. ***


- start             DEFAULT: no start cues.
Start time/cue(s) in the trial for the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .t, timeFromSync, startOf, endOf, response, responseBy, trigger, triggerBy, and, timeFrom. [] = no start cues -> element doesn't run.

- end               DEFAULT: no end cues.
End time/cue(s) in the trial for the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .t, timeFromSync, duration, startOf, endOf, response, responseBy, trigger, triggerBy, and, timeFrom. [] = no end cues -> element runs indefinitely unless it can end on its own.

- startBuffer
- endBuffer         DEFAULTS: none.
Time buffer to start/end (sec) if bufferable start/end latency occurs. Only for experiments where precise timing is important.

- syncExperimentAtTrigger
Not used by this class.

- staircase         DEFAULT: don't staircase element.
Staircase one or more input properties of the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .target, setExpr, min, max, setStaircaseExpr. [] = don't staircase element.



----------
INPUT PROPERTIES ALL VISUAL ELEMENTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 2.1 for full documentation. ***


- position          DEFAULT: screen center.
Vector [x y] setting position on screen (deg). - = left/up, + = right/down, [0 0] = screen center.

- layer             DEFAULT: 0.
Number setting layering on screen. + = backward.

- nn_eyes           DEFAULT: both eyes.
1 = show on left eye, 2 = right eye, [1 2] = both eyes. Ignored if stereo display is of (screen object property .stereo).

- rotate            DEFAULT: 0 deg.
Rotation clockwise (+x -> +y screen axis) about position set in .position (deg). (Psychtoolbox framework only)

- flipHorz
- flipVert          DEFAULTS: don't flip.
true/false: flip horizontally/vertically. (Psychtoolbox framework only)

- opacity           DEFAULT: no additional transparency.
0-1: 0 = fully transparent, 1 = nominal. (Psychtoolbox framework only)

- blur              DEFAULT: don't blur.
Blur filter level: width/diameter (box/disk) or standard deviation (Gaussian) of filter kernel on screen (deg). 0 = no blur. Ignored if .filterKernel set. (Psychtoolbox framework only)

- filterType        DEFAULT: Gaussian.
Blur filter type. String: "box", "disc", "gaussian". (Psychtoolbox framework only)

- filterKernel      DEFAULT: ignored.
Matrix: Custom convolution filter kernel. If you set .filterResolution then this is in the downsampled space. [] = use .blur instead instead. (Psychtoolbox framework only)

- filterResolution  DEFAULT: filter applied at screen resolution.
0-1: 1 = apply blur or other filter to element display at resolution on screen. < 1 = apply at lower resolution, then scale to screen. (Psychtoolbox framework only)

- backColor         DEFAULT: black.
1x3 RGB vector with numbers between 0-1 setting element background color if blur/filter is on. Ignored if blur/filter is off (most elements have transparent background then). (Psychtoolbox framework only)





RECORD PROPERTIES
PsychBench uses record properties to record information during experiments.
You can't set record properties but you can see them in experiment results using input property .report.

RECORD PROPERTIES ALL OBJECTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 1 for full documentation. ***


- who
String: variable name and possibly index you used for the object in the experiment script, e.g. "pictures(2)".

â€“ endTime
Start/End time relative to trial 1 start (sec).

- duration
End time - start time (sec).
