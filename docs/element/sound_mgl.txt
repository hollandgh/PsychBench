(MGL FRAMEWORK)

Plays an aif sound file. By default the element ends on its own when the file ends (so you don't need to set property .end unless you want it to end earlier). Note in the MGL framework you can't really end the element earier since sound output will still continue until end of file. Also start/end time precision is likely less than in the Psychtoolbox framework.

Many options available for sound elements in the Psychtoolbox framework (see sound_ptb.txt) are not available in the MGL framework. If you need them, apply them manually by editing the sound file.

See also class beep.





INPUT PROPERTIES
You can set input properties to specify how an object will show or run.
To leave any property at default, omit it (or leave = []).
==========



----------
Adjustable properties

You can allow the subject to adjust the following input properties of an object of this class during the experiment using an adjuster element. If you need to make other properties adjustable, you can edit the element class.

(None)



----------
fileName
dataExpr    DEFAULTS: play beep.

A string that is name of an aif sound file to play. Include path if the file is not in the MATLAB current folder or search path (or not the first file with that name on the search path).



----------
INPUT PROPERTIES ALL OBJECTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 1 for full documentation. ***


- label     DEFAULT: none.
Struct with any fields containing any values you want as custom information to see for the object in experiment results. Field names go to headings in results table. [] = none.

- report    DEFAULT: none.
Array of strings that are names of properties to see for the object in experiment results. [] = none.

INPUT PROPERTIES ALL ELEMENTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 2 for full documentation. ***


- start             DEFAULT: no start cues.
Start time/cue(s) in the trial for the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .t, timeFromSync, startOf, endOf, response, responseBy, trigger, triggerBy, and, timeFrom. [] = no start cues -> element doesn't run.

- end               DEFAULT: no end cues.
End time/cue(s) in the trial for the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .t, timeFromSync, duration, startOf, endOf, response, responseBy, trigger, triggerBy, and, timeFrom. [] = no end cues -> element runs indefinitely unless it can end on its own.

- startBuffer
- endBuffer         DEFAULTS: none.
Time buffer to start/end (sec) if bufferable start/end latency occurs. Only for experiments where precise timing is important.

- syncExperimentAtTrigger
Not used by this class.

- staircase         DEFAULT: don't staircase element.
Staircase one or more input properties of the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .target, setExpr, min, max, setStaircaseExpr. [] = don't staircase element.





RECORD PROPERTIES
PsychBench uses record properties to record information during experiments.
You can't set record properties but you can see them in experiment results using input property .report.

- who
String: variable name and possibly index you used for the object in the experiment script, e.g. "pictures(2)".

- startTime
â€“ endTime
Start/End time relative to trial 1 start (sec).

- duration
End time - start time (sec).

- n_startFrame
- n_endFrame
Frame number in the trial for first/last frames the element ran in. Start time = first frame start time. End time = last frame end time.

- startLatencyBufferable
- endLatencyBufferable
Start/End delay that might be reducible by setting .startBuffer/.endBuffer (sec). Only for experiments where precise timing is important.

- syncTime
- trigger
- triggerTime
- d_triggerTime
- n_triggerFrame
- numTriggers
Not used by this class.
