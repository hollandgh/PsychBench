A sinusoidal grating with a Gaussian envelope in a rectangular display area. Default is a grayscale grating that oscillates between 0-1 (black-white) in a square area. Uses standard formulas for grating and envelope--see gabor_open.m if you want to check them.





INPUT PROPERTIES
You can set input properties to specify how an object will show or run.
To leave any property at default, omit it (or leave = []).
==========



----------
Adjustable properties

You can allow the subject to adjust the following input properties of an object of this class during the experiment using an adjuster element. If you need to make other properties adjustable, you can edit the element class.

position
nn_eyes
rotate
opacity



----------
size    DEFAULT: square with sides 8 deg.

Side length for a square display area, or a vector [width height] for a rectangular area (deg).



----------
frequency    DEFAULT: 1.25 cycles/deg.

Spatial frequency (cycles/deg).



----------
phase    DEFAULT: 0.

Phase (cycles).



----------
rotateInArea    DEFAULT: sine grating left to right.

Rotation clockwise (+x -> +y screen axis) within the display area (deg). 0 = Oscillates horizontally. Use property .rotate if you want to rotate the display area itself.



----------
meanIntensity
amplitude
contrast         DEFAULTS: mean intensity = 0.5, amplitude = 0.5.

.meanIntensity is a number between 0-1 setting the intensity the grating oscillates about, also the intensity it decays toward at its edges due to the Gaussian envelope.

Also set one of:

.amplitude is max intensity - mean intensity. Ignored if you set .contrast.

OR

.contrast is Michelson contrast, amplitude / mean intensity. If you set contrast, mean intensity must be > 0.

For intensity, 0 = none, 1 = full. It's possible to set a combination of these properties that causes the grating to clip at intensity 0 or 1. See record properties .maxAmplitude and .maxContrast below.



----------
sigma          DEFAULT: 1.2 deg.

Sigma for a square Gaussian envelope, or a vector [s_x s_y] for a rectangular envelope (deg). Here "x" is the direction of grating oscillation, including rotation by .rotateInArea above if any. inf = no envelope.



----------
color    DEFAULT: white.

A 1x3 RGB vector with numbers between 0-1. This defines color at intensity = 1 (color at intensity = 0 is [0 0 0]).

INPUT PROPERTIES ALL OBJECTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 1 for full documentation. ***


- label     DEFAULT: none.
Struct with any fields containing any values you want as custom information to see for the object in experiment results. Field names go to headings in results table. [] = none.

- report    DEFAULT: none.
Array of strings that are names of properties to see for the object in experiment results. [] = none.



----------
INPUT PROPERTIES ALL ELEMENTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 2 for full documentation. ***


- start             DEFAULT: no start cues.
Start time/cue(s) in the trial for the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .t, timeFromSync, startOf, endOf, response, responseBy, trigger, triggerBy, and, timeFrom. [] = no start cues -> element doesn't run.

- end               DEFAULT: no end cues.
End time/cue(s) in the trial for the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .t, timeFromSync, duration, startOf, endOf, response, responseBy, trigger, triggerBy, and, timeFrom. [] = no end cues -> element runs indefinitely unless it can end on its own.

- startBuffer
- endBuffer         DEFAULTS: none.
Time buffer to start/end (sec) if bufferable start/end latency occurs. Only for experiments where precise timing is important.

- syncExperimentAtTrigger
Not used by this class.

- staircase         DEFAULT: don't staircase element.
Staircase one or more input properties of the element. Further struct or struct array with one or more fields: .target, setExpr, min, max, setStaircaseExpr. [] = don't staircase element.



----------
INPUT PROPERTIES ALL VISUAL ELEMENTS HAVE

*** See PsychBench Reference Manual sec 2.1 for full documentation. ***


- position          DEFAULT: screen center.
Vector [x y] setting position on screen (deg). - = left/up, + = right/down, [0 0] = screen center.

- layer             DEFAULT: 0.
Number setting layering on screen. + = backward.

- nn_eyes           DEFAULT: both eyes.
1 = show on left eye, 2 = right eye, [1 2] = both eyes. Ignored if stereo display is of (screen object property .stereo).

- rotate            DEFAULT: 0 deg.
Rotation clockwise (+x -> +y screen axis) about position set in .position (deg). (Psychtoolbox framework only)

- flipHorz
- flipVert          DEFAULTS: don't flip.
true/false: flip horizontally/vertically. (Psychtoolbox framework only)

- opacity           DEFAULT: no additional transparency.
0-1: 0 = fully transparent, 1 = nominal. (Psychtoolbox framework only)

- blur              DEFAULT: don't blur.
Blur filter level: width/diameter (box/disk) or standard deviation (Gaussian) of filter kernel on screen (deg). 0 = no blur. Ignored if .filterKernel set. (Psychtoolbox framework only)

- filterType        DEFAULT: Gaussian.
Blur filter type. String: "box", "disc", "gaussian". (Psychtoolbox framework only)

- filterKernel      DEFAULT: ignored.
Matrix: Custom convolution filter kernel. If you set .filterResolution then this is in the downsampled space. [] = use .blur instead instead. (Psychtoolbox framework only)

- filterResolution  DEFAULT: filter applied at screen resolution.
0-1: 1 = apply blur or other filter to element display at resolution on screen. < 1 = apply at lower resolution, then scale to screen. (Psychtoolbox framework only)

- backColor         DEFAULT: black.
1x3 RGB vector with numbers between 0-1 setting element background color if blur/filter is on. Ignored if blur/filter is off (most elements have transparent background then). (Psychtoolbox framework only)





RECORD PROPERTIES
PsychBench uses record properties to record information during experiments.
You can't set record properties but you can see them in experiment results using input property .report.

----------
maxAmplitude
maxContrast

Maximum amplitude and contrast where intensity would clip at 0 or 1, whichever is reached first, given the set mean intensity.
